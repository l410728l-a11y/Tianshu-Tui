/**
 * Turn-level heartbeat watchdog.
 *
 * Problem (P7): During long operations — large tool results, slow LLM streams,
 * compaction, multi-tool batches — the UI receives no events for tens of
 * seconds. Users cannot tell whether the agent is working or stuck, and
 * frequently interrupt to ask "what's happening?". The interruption itself
 * disrupts the agent's context.
 *
 * Solution: a heartbeat that fires only during silent periods. Every event
 * the agent emits (text delta, tool result, phase change) calls `tick()` to
 * reset the silence clock. If `silentMs` elapses without a tick, the
 * heartbeat fires `onHeartbeat(elapsedMs, lastActivity)` so the UI can show
 * "still working — waiting on <last-activity> for N seconds" instead of a
 * frozen spinner.
 *
 * The heartbeat is informational for normal silent gaps (tool/SSE idle
 * timeouts handle in-stream hangs). But the turn-boundary orchestration
 * (postTurn hooks → compaction → prewarm → perception, between a tool result
 * and the next model stream) is a watchdog blind spot: it neither ticks the
 * heartbeat nor re-checks the abort signal, so a wedged await there freezes
 * the UI with stale "still working" and ignores Ctrl+C. To cover that, the
 * heartbeat ALSO acts as a watchdog with teeth: if silence exceeds
 * `hardStallMs` (a ceiling well above any legitimate silent gap), it fires
 * `onHardStall` exactly once so the loop can abort and break the wedge.
