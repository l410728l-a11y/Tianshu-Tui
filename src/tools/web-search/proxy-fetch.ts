/**
 * Build a proxy-aware fetch for search backends. Reuses the shared
 * `resolveProxyForUrl` (config.network.proxy > HTTPS_PROXY/HTTP_PROXY env)
 * so a single proxy resolution path serves web_fetch, updater, and web_search.
 *
 * Without a proxy the underlying fetch is called verbatim — zero behavior
 * change for the existing direct-connect path. With a proxy a fresh
 * `ProxyAgent` is constructed per request; `ProxyAgent` keeps its own
 * connection pool keyed by target origin, and search traffic is low-volume,
 * so the per-request construction cost is negligible.
 *
 * The body-size cap (`boundedSearchFetch`) is layered on top so a single
 * wrapped fetch gives backends bounded-buffer + proxy behavior together —
 * no need to double-wrap at every call site.
